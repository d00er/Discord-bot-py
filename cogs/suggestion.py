If you need to save data of any type (like levels, money in the economy of the bot, etc) use a database. In this proyect I am using a database of mongodb. In the code is name as db_client.local. It also has 2 sub files called users and servers. Please try to use these and if you need to make other subfile tell me in the code. Each server in servers has this set of variables: id=str(guild.id), prefix=default_prefix, mute_role=None, level_channel=None, shop = dict, channelW= None,messageW= None, autoroleW= None,imageurlW= None channelG= None, messageG= None, autoroleG= None, imageurlG= None.
